                I am a web developer and programmer who has a passion for
                creating database driven web applications that support everyday needs.</p>
                
                <p>I hold an A.S. in Computer Systems Technology from Northwestern
                Connecticut Community College and have just about wrapped up a
                B.S. in Application & Database Development from Liberty
                University. </p><p>I have been hooked on coding since my first exposure
                to HTML in 2014 and have been coding daily ever since.
                Developing satisfies my creative side as well as challenges me
                to solve problems in unique ways. The satisfaction of finding a
                solution or creating something that looks and works well drives
                me to be the best I can be.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have worked in a variety of fields such as automotive,
                construction, retail, and manufacturing. I have also owned my
                own business. I believe I can leverage my background to
                implement coding solutions for a wide variety of applications. I
                look forward to helping you with your project.
